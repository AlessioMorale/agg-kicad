# @adamgreig's KiCAD Library

This repository contains my personal collection of KiCAD symbols, footprints, 
and related files.

## Schematic Symbols

To use, add relevant `.lib` files to your project libraries. There is one 
`.lib` file per symbol.

Each part contains supplier order codes and manufacturer part numbers where 
possible and sensible. Parts are drawn as per the KiCAD library conventions.

Check the README in each library folder for details and notes on each part.

## PCB Footprints

To use, add `agg.pretty` to your project libraries, with nickname `agg` 
recommended.

Where possible footprints are based on the appropriate standards and follow the 
KiCAD library conventions.

## Scripts

See the README in the scripts folder for detailed information on each script.
