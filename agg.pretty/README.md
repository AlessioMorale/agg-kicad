## Common Guidelines
* Origin on part centre
* Pad 1 on top left
* Ensure rotational symmetric for symmetric parts
* Text has size 1mm
* Silk lines are 0.15mm thick
* Courtyard is 0.05mm thick on 0.05mm grid
* Courtyard clearance:
    * 0.25mm normally
    * 0.15mm for SMD smaller than 0603
    * 0.50mm for connectors and crystals
    * 1.00mm for BGA

## Associated Documentation
* Has the footprint been validated in practice? With what symbol? Where?
* Link to any specific layout recommendations or requirements
* Any other notes / gotchas
